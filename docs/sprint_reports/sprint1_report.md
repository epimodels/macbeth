### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Contribution Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|TM1| For this milestone, I designed and implemented the frontend website look, during which I got React all set-up and working with Bootstrap and Django for our project. I had to do research into how to use these all together, as well as each one individually seeing as I've never worked with these or anything similar before. I wrote meeting agendas and notes, which allowed us to stay focused and on track. I set up each draft we had with the appropriate template edited to fit the project as well as the instructions needed to complete the assignment. I did the same with this Sprint Report and counted everyone's messages, reacts, and attendance for each meeting. Beyond all that, as a team we worked together and continuously discussed the organization of the project and basic design of the frontend, backend, and communication between the two to ensure we're incorporating our intended users, our sponsor's input, and what we think is best. I would say that our meeting hours plus our (mostly) individual hours shown above reflect how much was spent on this project during Sprint 1. |
|TM2| For this milestone, I helped figure out and set up PostgreSQL to work with our Django project. Our group also wanted to create a new User model that was more customizable for our project requirements, so I created a model to create a User and Superuser for the project. We also wanted a method in which we could quickly restart our application (remove database, recreate it with the new tables) for ease of developing. |
|TM3| In this milestone, I was responsible for reasearch and development of the API system that would be used to have the frontend communicate with the backend. One of the key elements of this project is to have a responsive front end, and I helped lead discussions on the different potential libraries and frameworks the team could use, both in the front and backend elements. I was also the team's expert on React, and was responsible for teaching the basics of it to the rest of the team so that nobody would be dependent on another member of the team if they needed to do something like implement a form. I also helped manage the git repo for the team during this sprint, including leading the merge of all our seperate projects to one repo, and resolving conflicts that would arise in the process. I also wrotethe sprint report script and created the video, including recording and editing.
|TM4| For this milestone, I implemented a rudimetary computation interface. This allowed the user to choose a model from a dropdown menu populated by the database, and to input parameters for the chosen model. Some basic calculations are then performed on the input, and the output is displayed. The main point of this was to allow for us to just switch out the calculation step with something more meaningful later in development, but the input and output can remain largely the same. Django handled the input and output of data while PostgreSQL handled the database.|
|TM5| In this milestone, I mostly did research on how to use the Django framework, and how to integrate it with PostgreSQL. I also did a good amount of research on how the epidemiological models provided by our sponsor worked, and fixed deprecation issues from the original code because it was written in Python 2s. |

#### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Communication Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|TM1| For this milestone, I feel like the counts do generally reflect on how much I communicate in the Teams group outside of our meetings, which I do to ensure everyone feels heard and is up-to-date on what's going on, whether that is concerning our next meeting time or the direction of our project. I felt like we did a good job meeting regularly despite our full courseloads and made a productive time of our meetings. We mainly communicated with each other through these meetings since we were usually able to efficiently target everything that was needed, so we often did not find a need to discuss extensively outside of those times. |
|TM2| I think our communication was generally good. When we had discrepencies regarding how certain items should be implemented, we had thorough conversations to make sure our team was on board or agree to go with a specific implementation. I find this important as for right now it is the foundation of our project. |
|TM3| Overall, I feel the communication of the team as a whole was fairly good. I did end up missing a few meetings due to either schedule conflicts or being sick, but in all the meetings that I attended, I heavily participated in discussion and design. Our team met and discussed a lot less frequently than other teams may have, but every one of the meetings were dense with information. I felt confident at the end of every meeting that I and my teammates knew what we needed to in order to succeed. |
|TM4| I feel like the counts do reflect a general idea of my communication for this milestone. Our team meets and communicates a lot, although there has been some slow starts due to the nature of us still figuring out all of the different tools and technologies we will be using (although we should be all good now!). As a team, we meet at least once a week, not including our biweekly meeting with our sponsor. Since we do meet so frequently, there isn't a lot of communication outside of those meetings, due to people being able to ask all their questions during the set meeting times. |
|TM5| I feel like the counts did mostly reflect how much I communicated during this Sprint. This sprint mostly involved research on my part, and there was not as much need to communicate outside of meetings. In future sprints, however, I plan on keeping my team more up to date on what I am currently working on. |

### Retrospective

[Recording to Link](https://emailwsu.sharepoint.com/:v:/t/2022.PULLM.CptS.421.423-MACBETH2/EQqKn5Oik4lGrt15t0_bHV4BnX3ZGt68ZQjiElBlfUSesA?e=JC3i67)

#### What went well
  - Initial draft to redesigned draft of project.
  - Utilizing GitHub and coordinating with team members.
  - Turnaround time was fast. Not many concerns regarding implementation / design.
  - Communication, regular meetings, and meetings with sponsors were all good.
  
 #### What we'd like to improve
  - Improve migrations so that we can better update our database.
  - Utilize GitHub Issues more.
  - Continue to improve using GitHub features.
  - Have clearer goals on what we need to do for the next milestone before starting.
  - End individual code addition earlier in the sprint cycle to allow for better code review.
  
#### Changes we plan to implement in next sprint period
  - Getting GitHub workflows to work.
  - Being able to compute models that are relevant for a user.
  - Implementing login and logout with session ids.
