### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Contribution Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|Mikaela| At the start of this sprint, we set 3 goals for myself to accomplish by thend: working on miscellaneous pages, adding a responsive navbar (depending on if the user is logged in or not), and fixing the user model to more closely match what our design draft detailed. I was able to accomplish all of these and more; I added a Home page with different cards (each can have its own individual theme, I made 3 default ones), I fully implemented the user story of logging out, the navbar now says "Register" and "Sign In" or "View Account" and "Sign Out" depending on the current access token, I updated the backend, api, and frontend to collect less sensitive user data (first, last name -> nickname, date of birth -> verify you're over 13 checkbox), and I updated the tests relating to users based on this new backend/api updates as well as adding more for logging out. I also mostly did this sprint report, counting the messages, reacts, meetings, and more. I feel very accomplished this sprint! |
|Kyle| <*Required*: The points and hours data are unlikely to tell the whole story about your contribution. Write a brief statement explaining and reflecting on your contribution to this milestone.> |
|Trevor| <*Required*: The points and hours data are unlikely to tell the whole story about your contribution. Write a brief statement explaining and reflecting on your contribution to this milestone.> |
|Ethan| During this milestone, one thing that I contributed by creating tab auto-completion for our bash scripts. As our scripts start to get bigger and have more commands, this tool will help us use our program faster. The other major thing that I contributed was the backend api of our job models. This allows the backend to store all jobs that a user has ever performed. These are saved to the user's account for later access. |
|Eric| During this milestone, I mostly did research on how to implement my issues in future sprints |

#### Reflection Statements
| Team Member | Communication Reflection Statement |
|-------------|-------------------|
|Mikaela| We did a good job on keeping in contact throughout this sprint despite how busy it got especially as we got into dead week. I feel like the counts above pretty accurately display how often I make an effort to engage with my team and keep myself and others updated on our project. I finally figured out how to keep all of my notifications on, so I see messages within a few hours of their posting if not sooner and I try to always respond somehow (either through a reply or a react). Anyways, now that we've been able to move past the sluggish beginning, it's been easier to discuss what we're working on and it's been easier to work alone and together throughout the sprint. |
|Kyle| <*Required*: The posts/replies data are unlikely to tell the whole story about your communication. Write a brief statement explaining and reflecting on your communication with your team during this milestone.> |
|Trevor| <*Required*: The posts/replies data are unlikely to tell the whole story about your communication. Write a brief statement explaining and reflecting on your communication with your team during this milestone.> |
|Ethan| I think that our team did a good job with building on the communication that we established during the last sprint. We met about once a week to discuss our ideas and struggles, and to make sure everyone was making progress. It also helped that we are out of the setup phase and have begun working on the real implementation. This has caused us to have a lot less roadblocks with needing to wait for someone else to finish their stuff. |
|Eric| I think the team overall did well communicating throughout the sprint. I personally need to work on being more engaged with the team outside of meetings.  |

### Retrospective

[Link to Recording](https://emailwsu.sharepoint.com/teams/2022.PULLM.CptS.421.423-MACBETH2/Shared%20Documents/Recordings/New%20channel%20meeting-20220501_152806-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?web=1)

#### What went well
  - We were able to do lots of planning at the beginning that really set up the rest of the sprint well
  - Utilizing "mini sprints" where we each sprinted towards a different goal each week was successful when we were able to do so
  - We checked in a lot more often with each other
  
 #### What we'd like to improve
  - We need to get better about leaving tasks to do at the last minute
  - We'd also like to get better at managing our time in general and consistently putting forth more hours every week
  
#### Changes we plan to implement in next sprint period
  - For people who find it helpful, we should figure out an individual's goals for the entire sprint rather than just one week at a time to help manage our time
  - We are planning on meeting more frequently and regularly, at least once a week but preferably twice or more as needed
