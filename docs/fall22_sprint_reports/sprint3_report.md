        In this sprint, I worked on implementing a stochastic model to be used in macbeth. I started with an old model our sponsor made regarding predator prey. This was initially
        written in Python2 and the library that it relied on had undergone a major change. I was unable to get the model to run reliably in Python3. Since our goal was
        to implement a stochastic model, I decided to implement a new model for Ebola. This one was less involved and had more documentation I could refer to to more
        accurately implement it. The result of this effort was a working stochastic model that can be used in macbeth. This was an important step as there was
        ambiguity on how this could be set up compared to the deterministic model. After this was completed, we were able to state with more certainty that
        as long as any model can return data that can be graphed, it can be used in macbeth.

#### What went well
  - We were able to move past big blockers
  - Adding new models works very well with the frontend, we've set ourselves up to be in a really good position for future expansion
  - We're good at thinking ahead
  - We have not had huge merge conflicts so far
  
#### What we'd like to improve
  - Usage of helpful tools
  - Attendance
  - Amount of deliverables
  
#### Changes we plan to implement in next sprint period
  - Implementation of Docker containers or something similar
  - Starting to do check-ins / threads to encourage more interaction
  - Create a plan for what we exactly want finished by the end of this last sprint
