        This sprint I worked on combining our compute pages into one; I was able to integrate our model select, our parameters, and our graphing into one page. I added a custom hook that made this process easier on me and have been working on designing and implementing this page as desired. I added a model info component, and added scroll views for the model selection/model info components and for the model parameter component. I ran into some problems with the way these components were set up since they expected to work independently of each other, so that took some work figuring out (1) what the problem was and (2) how to fix that problem elegantly. I had more outside coursework during this sprint, which is why I took advantage during my last two sprints and worked more than expected then.

        In this sprint, I worked on implementing a stochastic model to be used in macbeth. I started with an old model our sponsor made regarding predator prey. This was initially
        written in Python2 and the library that it relied on had undergone a major change. I was unable to get the model to run reliably in Python3. Since our goal was
        to implement a stochastic model, I decided to implement a new model for Ebola. This one was less involved and had more documentation I could refer to to more
        accurately implement it. The result of this effort was a working stochastic model that can be used in macbeth. This was an important step as there was
        ambiguity on how this could be set up compared to the deterministic model. After this was completed, we were able to state with more certainty that
        as long as any model can return data that can be graphed, it can be used in macbeth.

        For my portion of this sprint, I focused on implementing a worker pool system to run and save the results of computations to the database. Prior to this sprint, all run requests were being ran in real time as soon as the user submitted requests to run models, and were not saved in the database. I also worked very closely with Kyle to make sure everything implemented was compatible with our current flow for stochastic models. While the system is not fully implemented with the front-end, the API calls are all fully functional, and with this, a major user story was completed.

        This sprint I was looking into front-end testing. This is something that has been severely lacking and we needed to catch up on. Some of this process involved actually deciding on a testing library to use. Then researching how to use that library and how well it would integrate with our project. I started on writing the actual tests, but there is still a very long way to go. I also worked ona bit on calculated models being saved to the user's account but this work was overridden by our new worker system.

        During this sprint, I did some background research on the stochastic models our sponsor sent us to be possibly added to Macbeth. I also fixed some merge conflicts with a branch I was working on to add a new model.

### Retrospective

[Link to Recording](https://emailwsu.sharepoint.com/:v:/t/2022.PULLM.CptS.421.423-MACBETHV2/EVCv7T3HVgpIpmOaCy_FHiwBcO9t_ruzodbASZjiEQdvLA?e=rh7riA)

#### What went well
  - We were able to move past big blockers
  - Adding new models works very well with the frontend, we've set ourselves up to be in a really good position for future expansion
  - We're good at thinking ahead
  - We have not had huge merge conflicts so far
  
#### What we'd like to improve
  - Usage of helpful tools
  - Attendance
  - Amount of deliverables
  
#### Changes we plan to implement in next sprint period
  - Implementation of Docker containers or something similar
  - Starting to do check-ins / threads to encourage more interaction
  - Create a plan for what we exactly want finished by the end of this last sprint
