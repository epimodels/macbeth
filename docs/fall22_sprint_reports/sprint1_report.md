| Mikaela     | For this sprint, I worked on setting up dynamically graphing the results of computations, updating the parameter fields, and refactoring old code. I learned a lot over the summer about React and Bootstrap and wanted to implement better and clearer solutions for code previously written as well as fix bugs that we weren't able to fix last semester. Then, we know that graphing the results is the last step of our main goal, so I researched libraries and set one up within our project I found after discussion with the team. Since I had to wait for other features to be developed to continue on that, I worked on the parameter fields, in which I found many major bugs that needed fixed, so I did that as well as implemented a new user-friendly feature for seeing the default/currently set values. Because of having to wait on other features, I didn't have enough time to finish the graphing aspect, so I'm excited to work on that next and get this major achievement finished. I am proud of my ability this sprint to work consistently throughout and bring real change to our project. |
| Kyle        | In this milestone, I spent a good amount of time in the beginning cleaning up our existing codebase and branches. I thought it was important we refactor things that weren't working great before continuing to contribute to the project, especially since we haven't looked at the codebase for an entire summer. Additionally, I worked on logging while we determined the best way to perform a computation of a model. Overall, I am proud of the contributions I made to this milestone. I was able to help clean up the codebase, add logging to the project, and implement the computation of a model.                 |
| Trevor      | In this milestone, I spent a majority of my time focusing on doing research for the technology and implementations we'll require for the rest of the project this semester. We for the most part have deterministic models done and working, but stochastic models were going to require a lot more work. One of the big issues that come up with these random-chance models is that they need to be ran multiple times, and because they need to be ran multiple times, we need a way to communicate status in real time to the front-end so the user isn't left in the dark about what's happening. After researching, I determined we should use webSockets, and that django has a built-in library for them called 'channels'. I spent time learning how channels works, and how we'll implement it into the front end as well. In addition, I did research about how we might be able to use WebSockets to help decouple the API from the actual computations we're running, which can assist with scalability intot he future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Ethan       | During this sprint I spent most of my time looking towards the future and the efficiency of our workflow. I added batch scripts to allow for easy usage of the different applications on the Windows platform. Testing is also something we have been lacking in for quite some time. I took some time this sprint and will continue to take time in the future to ensure that our application is properly tested and working properly in all scenarios. Overall I am satisfied with the progress that I made this milestone and am looking forward to continuing testing and improving our code quality in future milestones. |
| Eric        | During this sprint, I initially assisted in cleaning up our existing code base and removing brancehs that were no longer in use. This was also a good opportunity to refamiliarize myself with the project code, much of which I had forgotten over the break. I also started changing out backend to support another epidemelogical model, which I will continue testing in the next sprint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Retrospective

[Link to Recording](https://emailwsu.sharepoint.com/:v:/t/2022.PULLM.CptS.421.423-MACBETHV2/EVwUcyYO9KtBiyRsHOAb8qAB28Ybeo58qj6O30ldtwLb2Q?e=H2Ltwa)

#### What went well

-   We did code review more regularly and more thoroughly.
-   We were able to utilize issues and break down problems better than in the past.
-   We did a good job of distributing tasks and working in parallel.

#### What we'd like to improve

-   We'd like to improve on getting regular meetings set up because once we do, we do great at consistent communication.
-   This also goes for getting regular meetings with our sponsor finally set up.
-   We also need to do better at spreading our work out over the sprint.

#### Changes we plan to implement in next sprint period

-   Create draft PRs for new branches so others can review as they work through the issue; it would be helpful in spreading out the review throughout the sprint rather than at the end.
-   Make a concrete, written-down plan at the beginning of the sprint that includes both:
    -   issues we plan to tackle and
    -   research we'd like to conduct.
