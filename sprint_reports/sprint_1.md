#### Reflection Statements 

| Team Member | Contribution Reflection Statement | 
|-------------|-------------------| 
|TM1| For this milestone, I designed and implemented the frontend website look, during which I got React all set-up and working with Bootstrap and Django for our project. I had to do research into how to use these all together, as well as each one individually seeing as Iâ€™ve never worked with these or anything similar before. I wrote meeting agendas and notes, which allowed us to stay focused and on track. I set up each draft we had with the appropriate template edited to fit the project as well as the instructions needed to complete the assignment. I did the same with this Sprint Report and counted everyone's messages, reacts, and attendance for each meeting. |

|TM1| For this milestone, I feel like the counts do generally reflect on how much I communicate in the Teams group outside of our meetings to ensure everyone feels heard and is up-to-date on what's going on, whether that is concerning our next meeting time or the direction of our project. |
